# Homework 13 - Multi-command CLI

This homework focuses on design and implementation of multi-command command line interfaces.

We’re using python and the click library to create beautiful user interfaces. You get to decide what your program does. Homework 13 is a multi-command CLI that serves up at least three subcommands

In this repository you will find the code for three CLI's that feed into the multi-CLI
- Add - This command adds a task inputted by the user into a txt file called tasks.
- List - This command reads from the txt file called list and lists all tasks added into the command line. The list starting at one and in order of when they were added.
- Done - This command gives the user the ability to remove or “finish” a task they previosuly added to their list of tasks, which then removes them from the txt file “tasks”.
