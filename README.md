- Add - This command adds a task inputted by the user into a txt file called tasks.
- List - This command reads from the txt file called list and lists all tasks added into the command line. The list starting at one and in order of when they were added.
- Done - This command gives the user the ability to remove or “finish” a task they previosuly added to their list of tasks, which then removes them from the txt file “tasks”
